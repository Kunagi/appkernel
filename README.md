# appkernel

Minimalistic Clojure/Clojurescript application framework.


## Documentation

`appkernel` provides a common API for issuing commands and queries. Extensions
provide functions for command execution and query answering.


### State

`appkernel` uses a single data structure for all application state.
Used in a [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) application, this would
be the `app-db`.
Used in a server, it would be a clojure `agent`.


### Queries

A query consists of a name and parameters, while the result is a map containing
the payload and metadata.

```clojure
[:shopping-cart/cart-items {:cart-id "76335E-EC56"}]
=>
{:cart-id "76335E-EC56"
 :cart-items [{:id "23" :title "The Joy of Clojure"
               :id "42" :title "Domain-Driven Design"
 :query/time 1239979303563}]}
```

To add new query capabilities to an application, you have to register query
handlers.
Multiple query handlers can participate in answering a single query.
